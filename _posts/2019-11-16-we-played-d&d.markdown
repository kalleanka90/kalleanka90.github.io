### How i almost killed the entire party

Me, my partner and 2 of my friends have been playing Dungeons & Dragons since spring 2019. I play as Belfyr the half-elf bard, my partner Sigrid play as Felicity the human ranger and Oskar play as Vanril the half-elf monk and then we have Joakim as the DM. We've played roughly 1-2 times each month for about 6h each time. 

At the start of the adventure we got a quest from a dwarf named Gundren Rockseeker to search for a cave called 'Wave echo cave' and a 1-handed mace called 'Lightbringer'. After running around in the world of fantasy for about 6 months now we finaly found the wave echo cave and started exploring it. At first it did seem like a huge maze but we finally found a path leading to some kind of building, we managed to slam down the huge doors that was held in place of melted hinges. Inside the room we fought a beholder, a floating monster with a big eye in the center and with eyes at the end of 10 tentacles. We defeated it pretty easy but when we did it just disappeared so we think that somewhere somehow we will have to face it's real body.  
When we searched the room we managed to find the Lightbringer that was mentioned at the start of the adventure but since we all were curious about this cave we decided that we would continue to explore it. After some diving in pitch-black water by me becuase of curiousity and scaring some Bugbears with an illusion by me and Vanril we found a room with 3 dark-elves and one of them pacing back and forth infront of a giant dwarf statue with green, emerald looking eyes.  
Me and Vanril tried to sneak around the pillars inside the room to get close when suddenly Felicity went out to close the door behind us just to make a cool entrance of kicking the door open with her bow ready and say *Yippee Kai Yay* m*** and loosened her arrow against the dark elf pacing infront of the statue and so the fighting begins again. The fight is joined by 2 big spiders from the ceiling that awakens of the sound of fighting. We barely made it out of the fight alive and we have all used up all kinds of healing we had with us, potions and spell-slots.  
My bard as chaotic neutral does the first thing that come to his mind after the fight and decided that i want those gem-stone that the status had as eyes. So i started climbing and manage to bend one of the eyes loose, as soon that it breaks loose from the status we all hear a big cracking sound from the room... The pillars holding the room begins to crumble the roof falls down upon us. The DM asks us to roll a constitution saving throw, i succeed and take half damage and survive with 6 health but Felicity and Vanril both takes full damage and get knocked out, i manage to get them stable and drag them behind a pile of rocks to hide.  
#### If Vanril and Felicity had taken about 5 more damage from the roof falling down they would've taken double max health points in damage and been killed instead of knocked down and thus would've ended their journey.
